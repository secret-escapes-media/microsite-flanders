    short-introduction: Together with my husband, we share our love of food and Bruges to visitors.
    introduction: Hi, I’m Annemieke. I live together with my husband Filip and daughter Marieke in the beautiful city of Bruges. Together with my husband, we share our love of food and Bruges to visitors. We own a B&B in the city centre, we are both official tour guides in Bruges and we offer a guest table-dinner at our homes. I’m a real foodie, I like cooking and eating out and tasting wine & beer. I love meeting new people and hearing their stories, while walking around in my hometown or having drinks & bites together.
    summary: "I love Bruges because it has a lot to offer. You have the very rich history, where you can talk about its flourishing medieval period and the beautiful buildings dating back as far as the 12th century. Although it is a city, it feels more like a village because it’s very cosy and easy to discover by foot or by bike. We offer very high-quality restaurants, food shops, beer & wine bars that serve excellent food and drinks. And on a cultural level, we have some amazing museums and churches spread all over town. My tips for travellers visiting Bruges would be:"
    pois:
      - content: The old Sint-Janshospitaal. This is the oldest building in the city (12th century) that you can visit. If you step into the museum, it’s like you are walking into a time machine and go way back into history. It tells you the story of the sisters that used to run the hospital and you can see paintings about that period of time and how medicine was then practiced. You can also see beautiful paintings by Hans Memling, that were made especially for the hospital. And with your ticket you can also visit the old pharmacy, that is still identical as it was in the middle ages. A must see museum!
      - content: Have a drink and some bites in the Vino Vino. This is one of our favourite bars in town that gives you a great sense how the locals enjoy food and drinks. They serve some of the best beers of Belgium, nice wine but especially great food to share. The chef changes his menu every few weeks, to make sure he can offer fresh seasonal products. He uses influences from all over the world and makes it all fresh on the spot. A great place to relax, enjoy a drink and just order as much food as you like.
      - content: Wander off to St. Anne’s Church. If you want to find somewhere quiet, go for a nice walk in the St. Anna quarter. It’s only a 10-minute walk away from the market, but you’ll see how quiet and beautiful it is. Take a look at the amazing Baroque St. Anne’s Church (one of the most beautiful ones of the city). Go and visit the very eccentric Jerusalem Chapel and check out the Lace Centre and the Museum of Folklife opposite of it. Or just walk around through the streets right up until the windmills and enjoy the peace and quiet part of Bruges.

    short-introduction: I work in the Antwerp Fashion Museum, MoMu, since it opened in 2002.
    introduction: I’m Katleen Derijcke. I work in the Antwerp Fashion Museum, MoMu, since it opened in 2002. I was trained by one of Antwerp’s leading fashion innovators, Linda Loppa. At the MoMu, I train the guides. I also give tours in the MoMu and I do fashion walks in the fashion district.
    summary: In 2001 I decided to move from a small village in Flanders to Antwerp. I didn’t know the city that well, but somehow Antwerp was very appealing to me. I sometimes compare Antwerp to a village, although we also have a progressive edge. You can wander in our small streets, where you can find some of the best designer and high-end vintage shops, excellent restaurants, design shops, museums and art galleries. Everything can be explored on foot! As I live in the old centre (with a view on our fabulous cathedral), I feel really blessed. Antwerp may have the atmosphere of a village, but it’s got so much more to offer!
    pois:
      - content: Dries Van Noten, his fasion palace, ‘Modepaleis’, in the old centre. Beautiful interior and beautiful clothes! Another of the Antwerp Six stars, Ann Demeulemeester, has her flagship store opposite the Museum of Fine Arts (for the moment closed, due to renovations).
      - content: Graanmarkt 13 combines both shopping, eating and even staying over. It has a basement restaurant, a fashion concept store on the first floor and an attic appartment which you can rent. To see some outdoor art for free why not enjoy a walk around our magnificent sculpture park, the Middelheim Museum, with works by Calder, Rodin, Ai Wei Wei and many more. If you like architecture, do visit Antwerp Central Station, our cathedral-like train station.
      - content: Do no forget to have a walk through the stunning houses of Zurenborg, especially the Cogels-Osylei, a fin de siècle street, with styles ranging from Belle Epoque to Art Nouveau.
