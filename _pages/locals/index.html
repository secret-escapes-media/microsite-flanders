    short-introduction: Together with my husband, we share our love of food and Bruges to visitors.
    introduction: Hi, I’m Annemieke. I live together with my husband Filip and daughter Marieke in the beautiful city of Bruges. Together with my husband, we share our love of food and Bruges to visitors. We own a B&B in the city centre, we are both official tour guides in Bruges and we offer a guest table-dinner at our homes. I’m a real foodie, I like cooking and eating out and tasting wine & beer. I love meeting new people and hearing their stories, while walking around in my hometown or having drinks & bites together.
    summary: "I love Bruges because it has a lot to offer. You have the very rich history, where you can talk about its flourishing medieval period and the beautiful buildings dating back as far as the 12th century. Although it is a city, it feels more like a village because it’s very cosy and easy to discover by foot or by bike. We offer very high-quality restaurants, food shops, beer & wine bars that serve excellent food and drinks. And on a cultural level, we have some amazing museums and churches spread all over town. My tips for travellers visiting Bruges would be:"
    pois:
      - content: The old Sint-Janshospitaal. This is the oldest building in the city (12th century) that you can visit. If you step into the museum, it’s like you are walking into a time machine and go way back into history. It tells you the story of the sisters that used to run the hospital and you can see paintings about that period of time and how medicine was then practiced. You can also see beautiful paintings by Hans Memling, that were made especially for the hospital. And with your ticket you can also visit the old pharmacy, that is still identical as it was in the middle ages. A must see museum!
      - content: Have a drink and some bites in the Vino Vino. This is one of our favourite bars in town that gives you a great sense how the locals enjoy food and drinks. They serve some of the best beers of Belgium, nice wine but especially great food to share. The chef changes his menu every few weeks, to make sure he can offer fresh seasonal products. He uses influences from all over the world and makes it all fresh on the spot. A great place to relax, enjoy a drink and just order as much food as you like.
      - content: Wander off to St. Anne’s Church. If you want to find somewhere quiet, go for a nice walk in the St. Anna quarter. It’s only a 10-minute walk away from the market, but you’ll see how quiet and beautiful it is. Take a look at the amazing Baroque St. Anne’s Church (one of the most beautiful ones of the city). Go and visit the very eccentric Jerusalem Chapel and check out the Lace Centre and the Museum of Folklife opposite of it. Or just walk around through the streets right up until the windmills and enjoy the peace and quiet part of Bruges.

    short-introduction: I’m a Bruges-born and based young dad with a passion for music by openhearted artists.
    introduction: I’m the Director of communication, marketing & sales at the Concertgebouw, Bruges’ cultural centre. I’m a Bruges-born and based young dad with a passion for music by openhearted artists. I love arts that open your mind, that bring people together, literally and figuratively. I’m very lucky to have Bruges as a backdrop to my daily working life. When I get the time, I really enjoy getting out into the beautiful countryside surrounding Bruges.
    summary: I really feel blessed with the rich cultural heritage, beautiful palaces, green parks and canals in Bruges. The charming, hotels and restaurants hidden along medieval streets, or simply the panoramic view of the city from the roof top of the Concertgebouw. Only the best is good enough for Bruges. It makes me proud to see the city embracing its visitors and inspiring its locals with fun new projects, like opening the canals to swimmers. I love to visit unique places like De Republiek which supports innovative young entrepreneurs and embraces local craftmanship.

      - content: Bruges may be small, but it has always been a global city with a strong focus on culture and heritage. Culture fans can experience this in the Concertgebouw, a contemporary architectural masterpiece and vibrant musical hot spot in the historical city centre. As well as having some of the best acoustics in Europe, the Concertgebouw is an international hub for musicians and music lovers from all over the world.  It’s worth visiting during the daytime as you can enjoy a multi-sensory tour at your own pace, there’s also an incredible panoramic view from the rooftop that allows visitors to see from the harbour of Zeebrugge to the towers of Brugse Zot brewery. You can even create your own musical composition using the historic Belfry Bells.
      - content: If you are looking for a lunch restaurant with healthy food, you ‘ll be charmed by TOU GOU, where tasty French cuisine is always on the menu. My favourite lunch spot however is De Republiek, with its summer and winter terrace.
      - content: If you want somewhere cosy to drink, try Lokkedize Bistro or if you’re looking for a café, Sanseveria Bagel Salon serves up gourmet New York bagels while the motorbike shop Hermanus serves coffee as black as oil.
      - content: If you are looking for something a little different as a visitor, check out Tourist Run Brugge. This short run through the streets and alleyways of Bruges, accompanied by a guide. is breath-taking early in the morning or early in the evening.

    short-introduction: I moved back to Ghent in 2003, following the family tradition set by my great grandfather who was a pastry chef, to open my chocolate shop YUZU
    introduction: I’m the owner of the chocolaterie YUZU, though I was once an art historian and archaeologist based in the Middle East. I moved back to Ghent in 2003, following the family tradition set by my great grandfather who was a pastry chef, to open my chocolate shop YUZU. Our chocolate creations are inspired by flavours from Japan, the Middle East and ingredients blown by the wind over the seven seas which set fire to your imagination. Chocolates are wrapped in a signature yellow box, which reflects the yellow colour of the Japanese Yuzu citrus fruit.
    summary: I have lived most of my life in Ghent and yet I still love exploring my city on foot, discovering treasures on every street corner. Every time you walk around Ghent, you are surrounded by history. Having Gravensteen Castle in the heart of the city gives off the medieval vibe. Also, the spectacular view of the three towers - St Nicolas, the belfry and St. Bavo’s Cathedral - remind you of the wealth of the city, which is also visible in the many churches and museums. For those interested in art, the Ghent Altarpiece by the Van Eyck brothers is just breathtaking. Ghent is a constantly evolving city where contemporary ideas and heritage are respected in equal measure.
    pois:
      - content: My top tip would be to take the time to discover the city by walking the streets, particularly at night when the city’s light plan illuminates the buildings and the city reveals her true beauty.
      - content: Don’t just visit the highlights in the city, try to explore deeper to find innovative places. I love to eat at WAY, a restaurant and coffee shop serving breakfast and lunch in an old factory in the former industrial quarter of Dok Noord.
      - content: Make time to discover the many local beers brewed in Ghent such as Gruut. To soak up the beer, grab some tasty Belgian fries on the go at Frituur Bij Filip, along the wall of the Great Butchers’ Hall. If you want to travel back to the 1930’s, head to the underground bar Jiggers for a well-crafted cocktail, just look out for the taxidermy fox with an eyeglass that marks the entrance.
      - content: If you are looking for something a little more formal I can recommend SAN, ran by Sang Hoon Degeimbre head chef of two Michelin star restaurant L’air du temps. Another top choice is PUBLIEK, the latest Michelin star restaurant from chef Olly Ceulenaere.

    short-introduction: I work in the Antwerp Fashion Museum, MoMu, since it opened in 2002.
    introduction: I’m Katleen Derijcke. I work in the Antwerp Fashion Museum, MoMu, since it opened in 2002. I was trained by one of Antwerp’s leading fashion innovators, Linda Loppa. At the MoMu, I train the guides. I also give tours in the MoMu and I do fashion walks in the fashion district.
    summary: In 2001 I decided to move from a small village in Flanders to Antwerp. I didn’t know the city that well, but somehow Antwerp was very appealing to me. I sometimes compare Antwerp to a village, although we also have a progressive edge. You can wander in our small streets, where you can find some of the best designer and high-end vintage shops, excellent restaurants, design shops, museums and art galleries. Everything can be explored on foot! As I live in the old centre (with a view on our fabulous cathedral), I feel really blessed. Antwerp may have the atmosphere of a village, but it’s got so much more to offer!
    pois:
      - content: Dries Van Noten, his fasion palace, ‘Modepaleis’, in the old centre. Beautiful interior and beautiful clothes! Another of the Antwerp Six stars, Ann Demeulemeester, has her flagship store opposite the Museum of Fine Arts (for the moment closed, due to renovations).
      - content: Graanmarkt 13 combines both shopping, eating and even staying over. It has a basement restaurant, a fashion concept store on the first floor and an attic appartment which you can rent. To see some outdoor art for free why not enjoy a walk around our magnificent sculpture park, the Middelheim Museum, with works by Calder, Rodin, Ai Wei Wei and many more. If you like architecture, do visit Antwerp Central Station, our cathedral-like train station.
      - content: Do no forget to have a walk through the stunning houses of Zurenborg, especially the Cogels-Osylei, a fin de siècle street, with styles ranging from Belle Epoque to Art Nouveau.
